	Use:   "delete",
	Short: "Delete a [Go]modoro from the database",
	Long: `The 'delete' command is used for deleting a particular [Go]modoro instance. For example:

gomodoro delete --id 2
gomodoro delete --id latest`,
	Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
		db.Init()
		defer db.Close()

		if id == 0 {
			db.DeleteLatest()
		} else {
			db.ExternalDeleteID(id)
		}

	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// deleteCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	deleteCmd.Flags().IntVarP(&id, "id", "i", 0, "ID of the [Go]modoro instance to delete. 0 for latest.")
	deleteCmd.MarkFlagRequired("id")
}
